                            term is for someone working remotely from an exotic location. Westerners on their laptops
                            are
                            everywhere, taking up table space in coffee shops or set up in one of the six separate
                            co-working spaces
                            inside a two-mile radius. They might be a small segment of <p class="under">the more than 5

                                each year</p>, but they’re overrepresented in Canggu. There are programmers,

                            marketers, scam

                            doing it
                            here.
                            Canggu, a small beachside village on the Indonesian island of Bali, currently <p

                            to work
                            remotely from them. It’s not hard to see why. The cost of living is low while the quality of
                            life — and,
                            crucially, the internet speeds — are high. For about $1,500 a month, you can live in a
                            private en suite
                            room in a villa with a swimming pool, hire a scooter to get around, surf every day, and eat
                            out for
                            every meal.
                            <h2 class="font-weight-bold">How about Indonesians?</h2>

                            But this workers’ paradise in Indonesia leaves out one crucial population: Indonesians.
                            <br>

                            As of 2017, Indonesia has the sixth worst income inequality in the world. <p class="under">A
                                2017 report from

                            that the top 1% of the country’s population control 49% of the wealth. Meanwhile, 8% of the
                            population
                            lives in “extreme” poverty (less than $1.90/day); 36% in “moderate” poverty (less than
                            $3.10/day). The
                            country’s economy is booming overall — but not equally.
                            <br>

                            <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Gonan Nasution </h4>, general manager of the<p class="under">
                                Taman Nauli Boutique Rooms hotel</p>, grew up in Canggu.
                            He’s seen
                            the area change from sprawling rice fields to a thriving tourist destination. “First the
                            surfers came
                            and then the yogis came,” explains Nasution. “And after the yogis, the fitness people came.”
                            Now it’s
                            the digital nomads, drawn to Canggu’s still-somewhat-authentic and affordable vibe.
                            <br>

                            Since 2012 or so, new hotels, cafés, restaurants, bars, shops, and beach clubs have opened
                            up every
                            month. Former farmers now lease their land to businesses, the vast majority of them owned
                            either by
                            wealthy Indonesians (many from Jakarta, the country’s capital, some 600 miles away) or
                            foreign
                            investors. Rice paddy plots are worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. Construction is
                            constant. People
                            at the top are clearly doing well, though the workers under them — the ones facilitating the
                            businesses
                            that digital nomads frequent — may not be.
                            <br>

                            <p class="font-italic">“The first four months I was like, what the fuck am I doing here?”

                            <br>
                            Indonesia doesn’t have a single minimum wage. Each district’s is set independently based on
                            its relative
                            GDP. In Bali as a whole,<p class="under"> it’s 2,297,967 Indonesian rupiah (IDR) per month
                            </p>, although it’s
                            closer to 2.5
                            million IDR in Canggu. That’s less than $180 per month at today’s exchange rate. According
                            to Nasution,
                            the workers in the coffee shops and co-working spaces getting the minimum wage are “living
                            on the edge.”
                            It’s enough for them to rent a room, buy food — and not much more. They’re living month to
                            month,
                            paycheck to paycheck. “Most of them work their whole lives,” he says.
                            <br>

                            Bali’s hospitality industry draws workers from all around Indonesia, including Haren Tambi,
                            the
                            community manager at<p class="under"> Dojo</p>, which is the largest co-working space and
                            cornerstone of the
                            digital nomad
                            scene in Canggu. While the membership numbers fluctuate as people come and go, Dojo normally
                            has between
                            200 and 400 people paying monthly. The cheapest plan costs 800,000 IDR ($55) for 30 hours
                            per month of
                            access to the space, while the monthly unlimited plan costs 2.9 million IDR ($205). Tambi
                            came to Bali
                            about two and a half years ago from Sumatra after finishing his bachelor’s degree in
                            accounting
                            education. Within a few days, he was working the front desk in Dojo a little bit above
                            the minimum
                            wage.
                             <br>
                            “The first four months I was like, what the fuck am I doing here?” he says. “I’ve just
                            finished my
                            bachelors and now I’m mopping the floor and cleaning out the fucking toilets. This is what I
                            get after
                            college?”
                            <br>
                            Despite the tough start, he’s only got good things to say about Michael Craig, Dojo’s
                            Australian owner,
                            and how he treats Dojo’s 43 Indonesian employees: “He’s a really good boss.” Dojo pays above
                            the minimum
                            wage, offers employees a big discount in the café, and helps them learn new skills, like
                            coding. Within
                            six months, Tambi was promoted to events coordinator. Six months after that, he got promoted
                            to his
                            current role as community manager. Things are a lot more comfortable for him now, although
                            he still
                            can’t afford to live the same lifestyle as some of his Western friends.

                            “I can’t go to restaurants every day,” he explains. “I’d be bankrupt in 10 or 15 days.”

                            A writer who works out of Dojo, who asked to be kept anonymous to avoid visa trouble, says
                            he’s been
                            living in Bali for almost three and a half years. He came for six months and just kept
                            extending his
                            stay. Despite being here for so long, he’s still on a two-month tourist visa — although he
                            sometimes
                            mixes it up and gets a six-month social or business visa. All he has to do is leave the
                            country once one
                            visa is up and re-enter a day later, very few questions asked. As a “tourist” in Bali he
                            doesn’t pay
                            income taxes — he’s officially a resident in Canada and declares there.
                            <br>

                            Other digital nomads I spoke with are in similar situations: They work from Bali on tourist
                            visas, do
                            visa runs to nearby countries as needed, and declare taxes in their home country. Not one
                            had a KITAS,
                            the official Indonesian work permit for foreigners.

                            <p class="font-italic"> “It’s just not fair for the locals. It’s so hard for us to get a
                                visa to travel, and it’s so
                                easy for
                                them to come here.”</p>
                                <br>
                                <br>
                            While digital nomads aren’t paying taxes to the government, both Nasution and Tambi stressed
                            that they
                            are contributing to the local economy. They’re the customers in all the new businesses.
                            While a local
                            might spend 20,000 IDR ($1.40) on a meal, digital nomads can easily spend between 100,000
                            and 200,000
                            IDR ($7 to $14). A lot of that money, of course, goes to the business owners, but some does
                            go to the
                            servers, cooks, and cleaners. They might not earn much in Canggu on the minimum wage, but
                            it’s more than
                            they would earn unemployed in their home villages.
                            <br>

                            Without the digital nomads — along with the <p class="under">>more than 5 million tourists
                            </p> come to Bali
                            each
                            year — many Indonesians would be significantly worse off. Bali’s new businesses present an
                            opportunity,
                            both to nomads looking for a cheap, comfortable country to work in and locals looking for a
                            way out of
                            poverty.
                             <br> 
                            But the ease with which foreigners can work in Bali understandably annoys some locals.
                            “These digital
                            nomads are on tourist visas and they just have to leave the country every month or two,”
                            explains
                            Nasution. “It’s just not fair for the locals. It’s so hard for us to get a visa to travel,
                            and it’s so
                            easy for them to come here.”
                            <br>
                            Tambi echoes his sentiments: “It’s hard for Indonesians to go to the U.S. It’s really,
                            really hard. Some
                            of my friends have family there and they still get rejected. They try again and they get
                            rejected
                            again.”
                            <br>
                            Everyone agrees that something should probably be done.
                            <br>
                            “It’s not fair to us who are working. We’re paying taxes,” Nasution says. He feels that
                            there should be
                            some kind of more expensive visa with background checks for digital nomads. “They need to
                            enforce some
                            tax or some rules for digital nomads.”
                            <br>
                            No digital nomad I spoke to was against contributing more financially to Bali, and some
                            believe it will
                            inevitably happen. The writer gaming the visa system puts it this way: “We’re breaking
                            brand-new ground.
                            This movement is still only young. People are going to be working on their computers all
                            over the world
                            for many years to come.”
                             <br>
                            Part of the problem is that the Indonesian government has bigger issues to solve. It’s the
                            fourth most
                            populous country in the world in the midst of major economic and social development. For
                            now, digital
                            nomads are living in a gray area — slipping through the cracks of a broken system not
                            designed to handle
                            people who can work from anywhere.
